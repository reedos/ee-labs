# The backlog: what is not built yet, and what it waits for

The director's ledger for the program in `PROGRAM.md`. Every lab in `EE_LABS_MAP.md`
has a row. Every item deferred by an overseer has a line under its lab's heading,
with the dependency that unblocks it. When a dependency is built, the director walks
this file and reopens what it unblocks. Nothing leaves this file by being forgotten.

Status words. **Built** is on the site. **Building** has an overseer and a branch.
**Planned** has a plan file and no overseer yet. **Waiting** has a plan or a map
entry and a named blocker. **Mapped** has a map entry only.

## 2. Deferred items, by lab

Each overseer appends here. One line per item: what, why deferred, and the
dependency or decision that reopens it.

### Circuit Elements Lab

- I9 the clamper and I10 the doubler: assigned to the seams overseer.
- H7 "the roots are the poles": assigned to the seams overseer.
- The GBW toggle: superseded by the Electronics Lab's op-amp macro, which Elements
  may import once it lands.

### Circuit Lab

- The impulse-response experiment (`CURRICULUM.md` seam 2): assigned to the seams
  overseer.
- A gain-bandwidth knob on the op-amp circuits: waits for the Electronics macro.

### Power Lab

- Groups D, F to N: no overseer in this program. The Machines Lab's drives group and
  the Energy Lab's inverters wait on F and L.

### Electronics Lab

- Group B lives in Elements as I9 and I10 (Decision 3).
- Groups D to O wait on lane 1's gate, inside the lab's own brief.

## 3. The director's queue

Items that cross labs and land at integration.

- `deploy.yml`: one `cp` line per new dark lab, from each lab's `NEEDS.md`.
- `progression.test.js`: every new lab's ids and counts, from each lab's `NEEDS.md`.
- Shared canvases promoted to `packages/ui` when a second lab claims them
  (`PROGRAM.md` §4).
- The nav fold (`ELECTRONICS_LAB_PLAN.md` Decision 5) in the first release commit
  that makes a sixth lab public.
- Three decisions raised by the Grid and Devices planner, for Reed. The suite's
  `n_i` pin is 1.5 × 10¹⁰ cm⁻³, and the band-edge densities give 1.08 × 10¹⁰, a
  20.7 mV shift in `V_0` if changed. The MOSFET threshold is 0.7 V in Electronics and
  0.32 V derived, which the Devices plan closes with a threshold implant. The Grid
  plan recommends `packages/grid` owning its own power-flow Newton.
- The one-line diagram canvas goes to `packages/ui` on its first build. The Energy
  Lab's props go in its signature (Grid plan, Decision 3).
- The Fields Lab's field-map canvas needs a one-dimensional profile mode for the
  Devices Lab. Sent to the Fields overseer as a need.

## 4. Planner entries

### Planner: Grid, Devices

Two plans, written together on `plan/grid-devices`. `GRID_LAB_PLAN.md` is 42
experiments in ten groups. `DEVICES_LAB_PLAN.md` is 30 experiments in seven groups.
Each line below is a dependency, what it blocks, and what unblocks it.

**Grid Lab.**

- Group I, the machine on the grid and stability (5 experiments): waits on the Machines
  Lab's synchronous machine, which is being built. The contract is a steady-state model
  behind a transient reactance, a fault model behind a subtransient reactance,
  negative- and zero-sequence reactances, an inertia constant and a mechanical power.
  Reopens when `lab/machines-lab` lands that model.
- `packages/grid`'s power flow: leans on the Electronics Lab's companion interface for
  its shape (`AGENT_BRIEF.md` §3.2), which is planned and not built. The Grid Lab owns
  its own polar Newton (Decision 2), so this is a shape dependency and not a code one.
  Reopens if the Electronics contract changes.
- B5's cross-reference to Power Lab I3, and C4's to Power Lab D1: both groups are
  planned with no overseer. The progression test fails on each reference until they
  exist, by design.
- The one-line diagram with power-flow arrows: new in `packages/ui`, with the Energy
  Lab named as the second user (`PROGRAM.md` §4). Its props carry that lab's needs from
  the first commit. The director's queue item is the promotion.
- `deploy.yml` and `progression.test.js` entries for `/grid-lab/`: through `NEEDS.md`,
  as every dark lab.
- The DC power flow's guard thresholds (10° warn, 30° refuse, `R/X` 0.25, magnitude
  0.95 to 1.05 pu) are set on one three-bus system. They move if the fuzz finds more
  than 5 % of branch-flow error inside the guard.

**Devices Lab.**

- `junction.js` additions: the file is owned by the Electronics Lab's lane 3
  (`PROGRAM.md` §5). The additions are new exports and no existing signature changes.
  The contract goes into `apps/devices-lab/NEEDS.md` and the director resolves it once.
  Reopens when Electronics lane 3 lands.
- Every group: leans on Electronics Group C's four closed forms, which are planned and
  not built. Cross-references rather than copies, so the progression test fails on each
  until Group C exists.
- The 1-D profile view: adapts the Fields Lab's field map, which is being built. The
  props needed are a one-dimensional mode, a stacked triple of charge density, field
  and potential on one position axis, and a bias knob that redraws all three. Phase 2
  runs against a local stub, and no group ships behind the stub. Reopens when
  `lab/fields-lab` lands the canvas.
- The value of `n_i`: `AGENT_BRIEF.md` §3.7 pins 1.5 × 10¹⁰ cm⁻³, and the band-edge
  densities give 1.079 × 10¹⁰ cm⁻³. Keeping the pin is Decision 1 and needs Reed's word.
  Changing it moves `V_0` by 20.7 mV and every Electronics C number with it.
- The threshold voltage: derived here as 321.769 mV, used in the Electronics Lab as
  700 mV. Decision 4 closes the gap with a threshold-adjust implant of
  8.1519 × 10¹¹ cm⁻². The cross-lab pin in phase 5 fails if the two labs disagree.
- F1 and F2 hand the photovoltaic cell to the Energy Lab, which is being built. F3's
  emission wavelengths hand to the Photonics Lab, which is waiting.
- `deploy.yml` and `progression.test.js` entries for `/devices-lab/`: through
  `NEEDS.md`, as every dark lab.

### Planner: Communications, Information

Two plans, written together on `plan/comms-info`. `COMMUNICATIONS_LAB_PLAN.md` is 50
experiments in eight groups. `INFORMATION_LAB_PLAN.md` is 25 experiments in six
groups. Each line below is a dependency, what it blocks, and what unblocks it.

**Communications Lab.**

- Group D, the AWGN channel and the bit error rate (8 experiments): waits on the
  Random Signals Lab, which is being built. Four objects are needed. The Q function as
  the tail of a Gaussian, a seeded Gaussian generator, the power spectral density, and
  the matched filter's `2E/N_0`. Reopens when `lab/random-lab` lands them. Nothing
  else in this lab reads any of the four.
- `createComplexChain(registry)` in `packages/dsp`: the chain runs one real number per
  sample and a constellation needs two. The contract is a mirror of `createChain` over
  an interleaved `Float64Array` of length `2n`, about eighty lines, changing nothing
  that exists. `packages/dsp` belongs to the DSP Lab overseer under `PROGRAM.md` §5,
  so this goes into `apps/comms-lab/NEEDS.md` and the director resolves it once. Phase
  1 needs none of it, and phases 2 to 7 all do. This is the plan's Decision 5.
- The constellation and eye canvases: new in `packages/ui`, with the Mixed-Signal Lab
  named as the second user (`PROGRAM.md` §4). Their props carry that lab's needs from
  the first commit, which are a decision grid that is not a constellation and a
  per-trace colour key. The director's queue item is the promotion.
- The BER canvas takes a `limits` prop from its first commit, because the Information
  Lab is its second user. That link is the only thing the two plans share.
- Group E's loops hand to Control Lab II, which is being built. The reference is to
  that lab rather than to one of its experiments, so the progression test allows it
  before that lab ships.
- Group H names the System Lab, which is waiting with no plan file. The four link
  budget experiments compute the noise floor, the path loss, one margin and one
  implementation-loss table. Antenna patterns, a real front end's cascaded noise
  figure and interference budgets are that lab's. The progression test fails on the
  reference until the System Lab exists.
- G5's LMS equaliser is the DSP Lab's adaptive filter, used rather than rebuilt. That
  lab is being built on `lab/dsp-lab`.
- H1's `4kTR` cross-references the Electronics Lab's Group O, which is planned and not
  built. The noise figure is assumed here rather than derived.
- The private `waveform-simulator` boundary (Decision 2): this lab models the link at
  the symbol rates its own chain renders and declines the high-speed serial and
  optical link, as `README.md` records. Reed's word settles where the line sits.
- `deploy.yml` and `progression.test.js` entries for `/comms-lab/`: through
  `NEEDS.md`, as every dark lab.
- The counted BER's hollow-point threshold, 30 errors, and the root raised cosine's
  span guard at 6 symbols are set on the defaults of §4.3. They move if the fuzz finds
  a case where the printed interval and the measured spread disagree.

**Information Lab.**

- Group F, the coding gain measured (3 experiments), and B4: wait on the
  Communications Lab's Group D, which waits on the Random Signals Lab. The contract is
  one function, the uncoded BER closed form, and one canvas, the BER plot with its
  `limits` prop. Reopens when the Communications Lab lands Group D.
- E2 and F3 read the soft metric, the per-bit log-likelihood ratio from the
  Communications Lab's `detect.js`. Same dependency, same reopening.
- Phases 1 to 5 build 21 of the 25 experiments and need nothing that is not built
  today. `EE_LABS_MAP.md` §4 puts this lab in step 11 with a note that it can slot in
  earlier, and this plan is the evidence that it can. The build order is the first
  decision for the director.
- Reed-Solomon's decoder is a stretch (Decision 4). C5 shows the code's distance and
  its erasure correction from the field arithmetic alone. The Berlekamp-Massey or
  Euclidean decoder reopens in a second version.
- The regular `(3,6)` LDPC threshold of 1.11 dB is quoted from Richardson and Urbanke
  and is not computed. Density evolution over message densities is a lab of its own,
  and no test pins the number.
- The trellis walker stays in the app under `PROGRAM.md` §4, because no second lab
  claims it. It is built against the Logic Lab's state machine prop shape, so a later
  promotion to `packages/ui` is a move rather than a rewrite. The Computer Lab is the
  candidate second user.
- Turbo codes and iterative demapping: declined by both plans. They need this lab's
  decoder and the Communications Lab's demapper iterating across two engines and two
  apps. Recorded as a seam, and it reopens only if a director decides the two apps
  should share a runtime.
- `deploy.yml` and `progression.test.js` entries for `/info-lab/`: through `NEEDS.md`,
  as every dark lab. No other shared surface changes, which is the smallest
  integration footprint in the map.

### Planner: VLSI, Computer, Interfaces

Three plans written on branch `plan/digital-upper`, from `PROGRAM.md` §3 item 1.
`VLSI_LAB_PLAN.md`, `COMPUTER_LAB_PLAN.md` and `INTERFACES_LAB_PLAN.md`, thirty
experiments each. No overseer for any of the three yet. The ledger rows in §1 stay
"waiting", and the plan column changes from "to write" to the three file names.

Dependencies, by what unblocks them.

- **`packages/events` from the Logic Lab.** All three plans state an assumed API in
  their §2.3 and mark it a contract to reconcile against the Logic Lab's brief when
  that brief exists. Reconciliation is a phase boundary in each plan, not an
  assumption carried through the build. The VLSI Lab needs `simulate` and
  `criticalPath`. The Computer Lab needs the same plus exact rational event times.
  The Interfaces Lab needs a net driven by more than one gate, for the open-drain
  bus, and its invariant 4 is the test for that.
- **Two canvases from the Logic Lab.** The timing diagram and the state machine
  diagram, per `PROGRAM.md` §4. The Computer Lab claims both as second lab. The
  Interfaces Lab claims the timing diagram with one added prop, which is a line drawn
  as its analog waveform with two threshold levels and a measurement cursor pair.
  The VLSI Lab reuses the timing diagram unchanged. The director promotes both to
  `packages/ui` when the Logic Lab ships them.
- **Three new modules under `packages/events`**, each owned by the lab that needs it
  and each requested through that lab's `NEEDS.md`. `extract.js` for the VLSI Lab's
  delay-extraction bridge. `cache.js` and `datapath.js` for the Computer Lab.
  `pin.js` and `protocol.js` for the Interfaces Lab. The Logic Lab owns the package
  under `PROGRAM.md` §5, so the director resolves each request once.
- **Electronics D5 and D6.** All three plans cross-reference the switch and the CMOS
  inverter by id, and the progression test fails on a reference to an experiment that
  does not exist. Each plan's Group A restates the results from its own model card so
  the group stands alone, and the cross-reference lands in the release commit once
  the Electronics Lab ships those two.
- **Electronics lane 1's MOSFET element.** The VLSI Lab and the Interfaces Lab both
  use the `switch` model of `apps/electronics-lab/AGENT_BRIEF.md` §3.1. Neither adds
  a field to that schema.
- **The Analog IC Lab's subthreshold model**, for VLSI E4's leakage. That lab has no
  plan. VLSI Decision 4 states leakage here from a stated 80 mV per decade as a
  labelled one-parameter model. Reopens when the Analog IC Lab is planned.
- **The Mixed-Signal Lab's converters**, for the Interfaces Lab's F4. That lab has no
  plan. Interfaces Decision 5 models the converter as a timing budget rather than a
  circuit, quoting only times and impedances. Reopens when the Mixed-Signal Lab is
  planned, and the two models do not overlap in the meantime.
- **The VLSI Lab, for the Computer Lab's gate delays.** Computer Decision 5 quotes
  them from the VLSI model card and pins them as functions of two unit values. A test
  compares both labs once both exist.
- **Signal Lab's Sampling group**, for Interfaces F5. Built today, so this is the one
  cross-lab link in the three plans that works now.
- **The Computer Lab's G2, for Interfaces G2.** The interrupt's cost in cycles is the
  Computer Lab's and the jitter it causes is the Interfaces Lab's. Cross-referenced
  by id in both directions.

Deferred inside the three plans.

- The VLSI Lab's gate-level half, Groups F and G, waits on `events`. Phases 1 to 4
  are twenty-three experiments and ship without it.
- The Computer Lab has one group that ships without `events`, which is the cache.
  The other twenty-four experiments wait.
- The Interfaces Lab's Groups B to E wait on `events`. Groups A and F, ten
  experiments, ship without it.
- Every plan's §10 lists what it declines rather than defers. Those lines are
  decisions and are not backlog items.
