# What the Power Lab needs from outside its own directory

The lab lives in `apps/power-lab/` and `packages/switched/`. Nothing else in the
repo was changed to build it, apart from the two entries listed first.
Everything under "at release" is deliberately not done while `RELEASE_STATUS`
says `dark`, and `src/release.test.js` fails if any of it is.

## Already in place (outside this directory)

- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` carries one `cp -r apps/power-lab/dist
  _site/power-lab` line after the Circuit Elements Lab's, so the build ships
  unlinked at `/power-lab/` for review. `release.test.js` pins the line.
- `package-lock.json` registers the two new workspaces (`@ee-labs/power-lab`
  and `@ee-labs/switched`) through `npm install`. No dependency versions moved.

## At release: flip `RELEASE_STATUS` to `released`, then `release.test.js` demands:

1. **Splash page** `site/index.html`: a lab card linking `power-lab/`, in the
   style of the Signal/Circuit/Control cards (~line 213 onward).
2. **README** `README.md`: a row in *The tools* table for Power Lab. It covers
   linear against switching, and the buck converter (volt-second balance,
   M = D, ripple, DCM, the CCM/DCM boundary, real parts), with the experiment
   count at the time.
3. **Nav** `packages/ui/src/LabNav.jsx`: `{ id: 'power-lab', label: 'Power' }`
   in `LABS`. Until then the lab passes `currentLabel="Power"` so its own nav
   names it without the released labs listing it back.
4. **Usage counter** `apps/power-lab/index.html`: the GoatCounter tag the other
   labs carry,
   `<script data-goatcounter="https://reedos.goatcounter.com/count" async src="https://gc.zgo.at/count.js"></script>`.
   Add `apps/power-lab/index.html` to the pinned page list in
   `packages/ui/src/analytics.test.js` (~line 109) at the same time. While dark
   the page carries no tag, so review visits do not count as traffic.

## Not needed

- No changes to `packages/ui`, `packages/explain` or `packages/network`. The lab
  uses `NumField`, `useCanvas`, `drawFrame`, `plotArea`, `COLORS`, `fmt`,
  `LabNav`, `ReportIssue` and `MathPanel` as exported today, and does not import
  `Schematic`.
- No hand-overs to or from the other labs yet. Two are in the plan's later
  phases: control of the buck in Control Lab, and rectifier spectra in Signal
  Lab. Each will need `handOverEvent` entries and a `HANDOVERS` table, in the
  pattern the Circuit hand-overs set.
